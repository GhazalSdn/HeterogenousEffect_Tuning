# HeterogenousEffect_Tuning
Spark is a distributed data analytic engine for speeding up applications processing big data. Multiple different configuration parameters in Spark can impact the execution time of an application. In this project, we use causal trees to investigate the heterogeneous effect of each Spark configuration on an applicationâ€™s execution time. Using these causal trees, we output a set of rules about the effect of each configuration. Both users and admins can benefit from these rules, as they can adjust the value of each configuration based on other configurations in order to get a maximum reduction in the execution time.
